<h1>What is Web Socket?</h1>
<p>WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing
	full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. The
	WebSocket protocol was standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455 in 2011,
	and the WebSocket API in Web IDL is being standardized by the W3C.
	WebSocket is distinct from HTTP.</p>
